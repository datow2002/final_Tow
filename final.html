					<h3>Changing The Game</h3>
					<p>Professional football is among the United States’ most popular entities, if not the most. If the commercials, fantasy football, and Thanksgiving traditions weren’t enough proof of that, 28 of the 30 most-watched television broadcasts of all time in the USA are Super Bowls, and eight of the 10 most watched television programs in the most-recently available week (as of the time of writing) were football-related. Clearly, football reigns supreme in the United States. In this vein, the NFL has taken steps to modify the game over time to keep the viewing audience engaged. Specifically, allowing offenses more freedom to operate while simultaneously making it harder for defenses to stop them. This has increased viewership of the game, but also fundamentally changed the game in one simple way: quarterbacks are more unstoppable than ever.</p>
					<p>A series of rule changes aimed at protecting quarterbacks and offensive players is among the primary culprits. A change in 1993 allowed quarterbacks to throw the ball away more often to avoid violent hits, and subsequent alterations in 1995, 2002, 2006, 2007, and 2009 outlawed many of the previously violent tactics used by defensive players. The NFL made many of these rule changes in hopes of making professional football safer and reducing the number of violent injuries.</p>
					<p>Former NFL quarterback TIm Hasselbeck said to InsideHook that these rules are helping players stay healthier, but also put up bigger numbers. “The effort to keep people off of guys’ knees and the head and neck area is probably the number one thing that has helped guys be healthy each and every week,” he said. “Quarterbacks have definitely benefited from an interceptions standpoint, a volume of attempts standpoint.”</p>
					<p>Fans tend to agree with Hasselbeck. A question posted to the r/nfl subreddit asking “Why do modern NFL quarterbacks accumulate more career passing yards than past QB’s” garnered around 30-35 responses, many of which came back to the same premise: the rules have changed to benefit offenses, specifically quarterbacks. u/nope96 summed up those responses by saying that “Penalties are biased towards the offense, offenses are easier for QBs to execute, QBs throw the ball more, QBs play for longer, see point one again.”</p>

					<h3>Evolving The Meta</h3>
					<p>Alongside the rule changes that have permeated football has come a fundamental change in how the game is played. No longer will offenses run the ball 40 times a game (except in rare instances) as they did in the past. With the rule changes that have made it easier for quarterbacks to operate, NFL offenses are throwing the ball more than ever, simply because it is, in most cases, the most well-proven and effective strategy to win football games. In other terms, heavily relying on passing the ball has become the new “meta” strategy in professional football.</p>
					<p>Meta, sometimes an acronym for “Most Effective Tactics Available,” is a commonly-used term in the gaming community. Simply put, it is the generally agreed-upon most optimal strategy to achieve success in a game. An example would be using a certain character in a fighting game, because their combination of statistics and traits makes them the most powerful character in the game, and thus the “meta” character. In football terms, the “meta” has become passing the ball as much as possible, as it has shown to be the most effective strategy for winning football games.</p>
					<p>This evolution of the “meta” of professional football happened alongside the rule changes that made it easier for NFL offenses to do their job. Just as the rule changes began in 1993, NFL quarterbacks began accumulating more passing yards since that year as well. Of the 22 quarterbacks with greater than 40,000 career passing yards, 14 of them began their career after 1990 (and thus spent the large majority of their career playing under the updated rules that began in 1993.) And even among the eight who began their careers before 1990, just four did not play at least five seasons with the updated rules, none of whom rank higher than 12th all-time in career passing yards. Clearly, the updated rules have had a drastic impact on NFL quarterbacks and the amount of passing yards they are able to rack up, and the numbers show it.</p>

			<h3>What Does This Mean?</h3>
			<p>Obviously, the NFL has shifted into a pass-first league, thanks to many of the reasons listed above. However, other factors are at play. Players are more athletically gifted than ever before, thanks to advances in sports medicine, nutrition, and training. Players grow up playing pass-first football, preparing them for the modern game. More indoor stadiums have been built, protecting against the elements that make it harder to pass the ball. Analytics have taken a major step forward, influencing game decisions in real time. More teams have joined the league, thinning the talent pool that plays every game (13 teams in 1950, to 26 teams in 1970, and now 32 teams today.)</p>
			<p>So with everything considered, the data and evidence clearly shows that the NFL has become a pass-first league that enables quarterbacks to accumulate more career passing yards than ever before. The only questions remaining are: where does the NFL go from here, and what changes allow the league to get there?</p>
